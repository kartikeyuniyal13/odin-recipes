    <p>Tea is one of the world's most popular and beloved beverages, cherished for its comforting aroma and soothing qualities. With a rich history dating back thousands of years, tea originated in China and has since become an integral part of cultures worldwide. It is made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, and its diverse varieties offer an array of flavors, ranging from delicate and floral to robust and earthy.

            <br>
           3 <strong>Add Tea Leaves or Tea Bags:</strong>
            <br>
            If using loose tea leaves, add 1 teaspoon of tea leaves per cup directly to the teapot or a tea infuser.
            If using tea bags, place 1 tea bag in each cup or in the teapot if making multiple cups.
            <br>
           4 <strong>Pour Hot Water:</strong>
            <br>

           6 <strong>Add Milk (optional)</strong>: <br>

           7 <strong>Add Sugar (optional):</strong> <br>
            If you like your tea sweetened, you can add sugar or your preferred sweetener while the tea is still hot.  <br>
           8<strong> Stir and Serve:</strong> <br>
            Give the tea a gentle stir to mix any added milk or sugar. Your classic cup of black tea is now ready to be served! <br>
